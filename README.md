COMPONENT DISCRPTION

1. Arduino Uno Wifi Rev2:
DESCRIPTION 
It is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Atmega4809 microchip, integrated with onboard WiFi capability for real-time data monitoring and control.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
It reads input signals from sensors (IR Sensor and potentiometer), processes them according to the control algorithm (PID), and generates PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) output signals for the ESC.

FUNCTIONALITY
Serves as the central control unit of the spin coater.
Executes the PID control algorithm to maintain the desired rotational speed (RPM)
Displays real-time RPM and process parameters on the OLED display.



2. Electronic Speed Controller (ESC- 30A Simonk)

DESCRIPTION
The ESC is an electronic circuit that regulates the speed and direction of a brushless DC motor (BLDC) by controlling the input voltage based on the PWM signal received from the Arduino.

WORKING PRINCIPLE 
It converts the Arduino's PWM signal into a three-phase AC signal required to drive the BLDC motor efficiently.

FUNCTIONALITY
Acts as an interface between Arduino and the BLDC motor.
Controls the motor speed (RPM) as per Arduino’s PWM output.



3.A2212 1400KV Brushless DC Motor
DESCRPTION
The DC Motor is a high-speed, lightweight motor commonly used in drones and laboratory equipment requiring stable rotation.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
It operated on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The rotating magnetic field generated by the ESC’s three-phase AC signal causes continuos rotation of the rotor magnets.

FUNCTIONALITY
Drives the spinning substrate holder, providing the centrifugal force required to speed the liquid coating evenly.



4.12V 10A SMPS Power Supply
DESCRIPTION
The switch mode power supply (SMPS) provides a regulated 12V DC output from the AC mains. It is capable of delivering high current (up to 10A), suitable for powering the motor and other electronic components.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
It uses high-frequency switching and voltage regulation to convert 220V AC into a stable 12V DC output efficiently.

FUNCTIONALITY
Supplies electrical power to the ESC, motor, Arduino, and display circuit.


 
5.DC-DC Buck Convertor
DESCRIPTION
The DC-DC Buck Converter is a voltage step-down device that converts the 12V DC from the SMPS into lower voltage levels (5V) suitable for sensors and Arduino.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
It uses a high-speed switching transistor, inductor, and capacitor to reduce DC voltage while maintaining energy efficiency.


FUNNCTIONALITY
Provides a regulated 5V DC power supply to the Arduino board, IR sensor, and OLED display.



6.OLED Display (SSD1306)
DESCRIPTION
The OLED display modules based on the SSD1306 driver are a compact, high-contrast screen for displaying system parameters.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
The SSD3106 driver communicates with the Arduino vis I2C interface to display digital text and graphical data using self-emissive organic pixels.

FUNCTIONALITY
Displays real-time motor RPM, set speed, and other system parameters.
Helps in monitoring and tuning the performance of the spin coater.



7.XH-A954 Potentiometer
DESCRIPTION
The XH-A954 potentiometer is a variable resistor that provides adjustable voltage levels to the Arduino’s analogue input.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
As the user rotates the potentiometer knob, the resistance changes, which varies the analogue voltage signal sent to the Arduino.
FUNCTIONALITY
Acts as a manual speed control input, allowing users to set the desired RPM of the motor.



8.TCRT5000 IR Sensor
DESCRIPTION
The IR Sensor is an infrared reflective optical sensor module consisting of an IR emitter and a phototransistor.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
It detects reflected infrared light from the rotating encoder disc attached to the motor shaft or substrate holder. Each reflection corresponds to one revolution, enabling RPM measurement.

FUNCTIONALITY
Measures real-time motor speed (RPM) 
Provides feedback to the Arduino for PID control, ensuring accurate RPM regulation.
